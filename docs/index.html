          The data on anxiety and depression in these last few charts comes from the CDC Household Pulse
          Survey, which was conducted via online surveys. While this data was collected for the purpose of
          gauging the prevalence of mental health concerns during the pandemic, it is important to note
          that the data collection methods and response rate on this survey differed from most national
          surveys that the CDC conducts.
